# Tutorial `numpy` for ML@LPC

This repository hosts the material of a tutorial to `numpy` in the context of a working group at [Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont](http://clrwww.in2p3.fr/) related to machine learning and its application in (high energy) physics. This tutorial is split into three parts, trying go from first principles to current (known) limitations for high energy physics.


## 1. Introduction to `numpy`

This first part detailed in [this notebook](notebook_section1) motivates the use of `numpy` inside python and, also, why it is interesting to use python! The basic `numpy` object, `numpy.array`, is introduced emphasizing differences with usual python lists. Then the three key concepts on which `numpy` is based are presented (broadcasting, indexing/slicing, vectorization) and simple examples are given to illustrate each of them. Finally, a quick tour of two important tools interfaced with `numpy` is given, namely `pandas` (*database-like* objet) and `matplotlib` (plotting package).


## 2. Use cases for collider physics



## 3. Limitations and possibles workarounds
