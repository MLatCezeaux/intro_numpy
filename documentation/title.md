title: "Numpy for High Energy Physics"
author: [Romain Madar]
institute: "Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont-Ferrand"
abstract: "These notes describe the material presented in a NumPy tutorial in the context of a working group at Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont related to machine learning and applications in physics. This tutorial is split into three parts, going from first principles to some limitations for High Energy Physics (HEP), and some possible workarounds. This tutorial reflects my current understanding and some newer/better approach might exist (feel free to [contact me](mailto:romain.madar@clermont.in2p3.fr)!). This tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of python."
